    | Thank you for your interest in Jie Jie and Friends animated storybooks! We believe passionately about the importance of reading, 
    | and our books focus on helping kids develop an interest in Chinese, learn new words and grow vocabulary.
  p   
    | We know why most kids don’t enjoy reading Chinese books and we can’t blame them. Honestly, how many of us get excited about unentertaining and wordy stories?
    | Jie Jie & Friends wants to change that. Our entertaining and educational digital books feature loveable characters, an exciting fantasy story, cute animation and realistic voice over. These are books your kids will want to read.

  p 
  | We produce 3 carefully-created animated storybooks a month, and each book satisfies 3 criteria:
  ol
    li Chinese books your kids want to read 
    li Helps your kids learn vocab 
    li Enables you to bond with your kids
